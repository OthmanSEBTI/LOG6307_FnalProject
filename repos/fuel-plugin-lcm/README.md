# The Fuel LCM Plugin

This plugin is intended to provide the cluster users the tools to manage the cluster nodes after the cluster have been deployed. It can deploy several LCM nodes with the Puppet master and Foreman Dashboard installed.
These nodes are using HA fallback and can apply different custom Puppet
manifests on other cluster nodes. It can be used to apply updates, fixes,
modifications or even install additional services or audit the systems
configuration.
